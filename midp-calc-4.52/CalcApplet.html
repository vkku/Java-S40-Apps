<p>
This demo applet is an exact copy of the original MIDP application that runs
on a mobile phone. The application should ideally work in the same way on your
mobile phone as it does in this applet, except perhaps that the setup screen
doesn't show up on all phones. Another exception is the entering of HEX
numbers, which relies on key-repeat events, this works only when
entering numbers by mouse-clicks, not by keyboard.

<p>
The demo can be operated entirely by mouse, clicking on different areas of the
"screen" activates the menu just as the joystick would. The "<-" button
simulates the clear key, the "."  button simulates the "*" key, and the "-/e"
button simulates the "#" key.

<p>
The applet can also be operated entirely by the keyboard. Arrow keys work as
joystick directions and "home" serves as the middle of the joystick. For ease
of use, the "." key works the same as the "*" key, and "-" and "e" works the
same as "#". "+", "ENTER" and the number keys correspond to the same keys on
the phone.

<p>
If you exit the demo by selecting mode/sys/exit, the demo applet will
attempt to save the state of the calculator in a cookie. I expect there
can be trouble if you have allocated a gigantic matrix.
